                        <p>In the process of making an application to an idea with structuration and standardisation of the existing market of Augmented Reality Application, productivity tool. Research on the AR application usability, and the component requirement to make the application more user friendly and compactable with latest trend pattern. Environment of home screen needs to have all the component as a frame work which can be beautified and made with the level design by my team member for Hi-Fi Design. <br> <sub> Project Timeline (6 Weeks) </sub> </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#0b677c"> Aims & Objective </h2>
                    <p>To make an exoskeleton for an AR application which have the potential to play as a tool and productivity kit with insights of social contribution and make the tools more user friendly with handy interface and interaction with simplest navigation. </p>
                    <span class="image fit" style="border-top:none !important"><img src="images/pal/mood.png" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>The objective was to start from basic on paper sketching which was starting the application design out of scrap. The Lo-Fi Model is divided into two phases where to find the interaction nodes and map them to application architecture. </p>

                <p style="border-top:none !important">The user and functional requirement are linked which needs to have a good finding of what interface elements will make the user navigation and engagement easier. The user can be of any background and can be novice to the AR environment. So we kept the interaction element placement and finding easy while with a guide tips tour, when a user starts using the application for the first time.</p>

                        <dd>
                            <p>The walkthrough will give a small and brief narrative to use the application and make it easier for the novice user to get use to and know the interface and response of button and their redirection screen. They are also a guide to show the navigation of the user to all the interaction screen. And we place the call to action at the end of the animation to show the end of the interaction and help the user process the interaction elements and accept that they understand the process and can do it by themselves. The process focus on what and how. This was not achieved by any traditional ways of screen interaction. It was done with the animation character “Planet Pal” that gives a tips with animation and character interaction with user and help the user achieve the goal.</p>
