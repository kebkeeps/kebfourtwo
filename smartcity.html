                        <p>The smart city vision of Raipur Smart City Limited (RSCL) for Raipur includes several Pan City and Area Based Development initiatives with a focus on both infrastructure and ICT advancements across the city and at strategic locations. The strategic focus of the city has been identified to improve mobility, improve situational awareness, enhance public safety and security, and introduce data driven decision making. </p>

                    <p>The ICCC solution integrates and uses data from multiple sources and makes sense of it on a single interface. It simplifies the disarray and multiplication of data sources that are necessary for understanding, yet that are too voluminous for easy consumption. ICCC provides a single interface to all systems of an enterprise or city to make them usable without being overwhelming. A flexible rules-based data flow directs large quantities of data into a structured format that can be used for reports and key performance indicators (KPIs). ICCC brings events to the surface and alerts action when needed. It also provides a web-based, configurable interface that is specific to the user’s role and needs so that everyone in the organization can see and collaborate on the same data in their own way. This ability to collaborate allows synchronization of effort, audit trails, collaboration, and group decision making. It also can help to synchronize and analyze efforts among sectors and agencies as they happen, giving decision makers consolidated information that helps them anticipate, rather than react, to problems.</p>

                        <p style="border-top:none !important">At a high level, the structure of IBM® Intelligent Operations Center can be divided into major components, subsystems, and services. The following diagram shows a high-level view of IBM Intelligent Operations Center.</p>
                        <span class="image fit" style="border-top:none !important"><img src="images/victor/arch1.png" alt="" /></span>
                        <p style="border-top:none !important">The application server provides a set of services for accessing and visualizing data that is managed by IBM Intelligent Operations Center. The data ingest service is used to import data from disparate external sources, such as databases and files. Because of the variety of data that can be supplied from these external sources, the data is normalized into a common format that can be used to calculate key performance indicators, trigger standard operating procedures and notifications, provide spatial-temporal data, and provide inputs to a variety of analytics.
                            The key performance indicator (KPI) service monitors incoming data items, and uses the information that is contained in the data items to generate KPIs. In the user interface layer, users can view KPIs, standard operating procedures, notifications, and reports. Users can also view spatial-temporal data on a geospatial map, or they can view specific details that represent a building or a stadium on a location map, in a list or calendar view, or on a chronological timeline. Also, users can view the results of analytics in charts or lists, or on the map.
                            The application server provides security services that ensure only authorized users and groups can access data.

                                The integration of new and existing smart elements with IBM IOC should leveraged the Internet of Things (IOT) architectural pattern. 
                                The common methodology for integration will not only ease the deployment of the platform and also will help in manageabililty of the solution in long term.
                                The Smart Element Integration approach will be finalized based on integration design pattern provided by Smart Element sub-system. It will be done using data ingestion service of IBM IOC platform; any of the following mechanisms can be adapted based on the subsystem’s integration capability </p>
