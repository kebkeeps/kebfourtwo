				<p> Data will be pushed by Smart Components Vendor Solutions via JSON format using REST API to ICCC. </p>
				<p> <b>ICCC Capabilities: </b> The ICCC will be implemented using IBM Intelligent Operations center (IBM IOC) solution. Following are the out of the box product capabilities that are realized either directly or by customization of the base product:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b> Integrated Smart City Platform </b> - The IOC provides easy to use, Web-based one-stop application to manage security information, incidents, and overall security status of the enterprise. For operational users and City Officials, the interface allows personalization of the information with a variety of pre-configured views in commonly used formats. All access to information is controlled by organizational roles to prevent unauthorized access, while at the same time enabling the easy management of each user’s access to information to balance the ‘need to share’ while respecting ‘need to know’ principles. They can rapidly access the information they need from the IOC’s centralized system. 
					</li>
					 <br>
					<li>
						<b> Incident Reporting & Management </b>– IOC offers multiple services & capabilities that support the management & detection of incidents. Some of the notable ones are: <br> <br>

								<b>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</b> – The KPIs provide the ability to create key measurements based on the data made available to the Intelligent Operations Center through integration with other applications and data feeds. For Smart City solution, defining those KPIs set the baseline and act as framework for measuring operational performances. These KPI’s are then tracked, often providing information displayed in the executive dashboard and being used as the basis for generating incidents and events when defined thresholds are exceeded. <br>
					
								<b>Alerts, Notification and Presentation</b> – It enables displaying of the incidents on a geospatial view or map or in incident lists, sending alerts or notifications to affected or responsible security officers and relevant stakeholders. <br>

								<b>Status Updates </b> – It supports the entry and publication of updated status information associated with an incident.<br>

								<b>Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) </b> – SOP Toolkit helps in creation of operational procedures to enable the users to respond to scenario specific incidents. When an event occurs a standard operating procedure may be applied to it either automatically or manually. The procedure may include automated or manual steps which are managed as a workflow by Intelligent Operations Center. Automating those SOPs will significantly improve the response time. <br>

								<b>Event Detection </b> – It is a rule-based capability that recognizes incidents as they occur within the data being fed to the IBM Intelligent Operations Center. These are often based on the scenario specific Events or KPIs breaches, which are user defined within the IOC. This provides the ability to accept incidents generated by external systems. <br>

								<b>Incident Correlation </b> – It is an advanced ability to recognize incidents that are related to one another and create higher-level incidents, create and send notifications or raise priorities based on that analysis. Correlation is established between events generated from same geo coded location and have same time of occurrence. <br>
					
					</li>
<br>
					<li>
						<b> Dashboard </b>– It provides the mechanism for visually representing the overall status of the key functions of the Smart City Operations. Analytical view provides the capability that allows users to explore the underlying detailed status of the information to a depth relevant to their role. It is based on a common view of the situation, so that all stakeholders have the same understanding of city priorities.
					</li>
<br>
					<li>
						<b>Geospatial mapping </b>– Geospatial Information is the key reference for the Smart City implementation; It a mechanism for displaying user-selected information overlaid on a map of the area of interest. Multiple map layers may depict equipment or other assets, events, positions of resources available to the city boundaries of designated areas or any other GIS information. Assets & Smart Element Events can be displayed on the map and may be used to initiate relevant actions through clickable menus. 
					</li>
<br>
					<li>
					<b>Multi-Agency Collaboration </b>– is a set of collaboration tools (integrated with the solution) to support immediate communications between all operations staff and supporting agencies with access (direct or indirect) to the IOC. This supports messaging between operators and the sharing of information, with the aim of reduce response time, sharing information effectively and enabling collaborative decision making in a controlled and assured environment. 
					</li>
<br>
					<li>
					<b>Situational Awareness </b>– all of the capabilities of Intelligent Operations Center, taken together – the dashboards, the geospatial maps, the integration of application data, advanced analytics, and event management - all provide the shared situational awareness need to enable security staff and supporting Agencies to synchronize and prioritize task. The common view is very important to deal crisis situations and IOC offers this very key aspect.
					</li>
<br>
					<li>
						<b> Domain Analytics </b> is a set of analytical tools, included to enable crisis operations analytical functionality. These tools will aid decision makers to pre-empt situations as they unfold by comparing current activities with historical events or by using analytics to gain insight which enable proactive management of unfolding situations. Real-time view of incidents, Historical knowledge, Time wise view for many of the incidents (fire, theft, security breach, Environment, panic alerts) are some of the important benefits which will help to gather analytics driven intelligence.
